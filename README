I've just started playing here, so I'm not really sure how well this will work.  Here's my path so far:

REFERENCES:
https://store.docker.com/images/datastax?tab=description
https://hub.docker.com/r/datastax/dse-opscenter/
https://hub.docker.com/r/datastax/dse-studio/


1) Download and install Docker on the Mac.
2) Go to https://store.docker.com/ and register an ID.  You must authenticate using an ID to download the DSE image.
3) Login to the docker store
	docker login
        (enter credentials created in step 2)
4) Pull the 3 docker images (DSE, Opscenter, Studio)
	docker pull store/datastax/dse-server:5.1.5
        docker pull datastax/dse-opscenter
        docker pull datastax/dse-studio
5) Create a folder to place the docker-compose.yml and the init.sh into.

6) I created a script to does a little house keeping to make things easier.  It creates the necessary mount folders to persist data outside the docker containers, and also gives you a place to access and update config files easily.  To launch the demo environment, simply execute the script:
	./init.sh

7) Once everything is running, you can connect to Opscenter using the url:
	http://localhost:8888/

connect to the existing cluster using the service name 'dse' as the hostname

8) Launch studio using the URL:
	http://localhost:9091
set the connection using the service name 'dse' as the hostname

All the basics seem to be working and I'm just starting to validate more functionality.
