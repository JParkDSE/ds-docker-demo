My goal here was very simple.  I wanted an environment for my laptop where I could easily test, destroy, and otherwise play based with the Docker dev images.  The entire purpose if this effort was to Keep It Simple !  There are lots of advanced techniques if this was intended for "the real world".  My world is a demo world, and reality is merely a concept in this world.

Therefore, it is a single docker-compose file, a single node, a fair amount of hackery to deal with the basics, etc.  THIS IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE, BEST PRACTICE, OR SUGGESTED PATH.  Just simple and functional.

I may do some additional tweaking to the script over time to simplify other common things, but to use this example, you will need a fairly functional knowledge of Docker and all of it's concepts to make effective use of the environment.  However, this gives a great head start.

1) Download and install Docker on the Mac.
2) Go to https://store.docker.com/ and register an ID.  You must authenticate using an ID to download the DSE image.
3) Login to the docker store
	docker login
        (enter credentials created in step 2)
4) Pull the 3 docker images (DSE, Opscenter, Studio)
	docker pull store/datastax/dse-server:5.1.5
        docker pull datastax/dse-opscenter
        docker pull datastax/dse-studio
5) Create a folder to place the docker-compose.yml and the init.sh into.

6) I created a script to does a little house keeping to make things easier.  It creates the necessary mount folders to persist data outside the docker containers, and also gives you a place to access and update config files easily.  To launch the demo environment, simply execute the script:
	./init.sh

7) Once everything is running, you can connect to Opscenter using the url:
	http://localhost:8888/

connect to the existing cluster using the service name 'dse' as the hostname

8) Launch studio using the URL:
	http://localhost:9091
set the connection using the service name 'dse' as the hostname

All the basics seem to be working and I'm just starting to validate more functionality.
